# AI Turkish Text Corrector

## What It Does

AI Turkish Text Corrector is a Chrome extension that automatically adds a "🤖 Düzelt" (Correct) button to rich text editors (CKEditor, Summernote, TinyMCE, Quill) on websites.

Using OpenAI's GPT-4o model, it corrects your Turkish texts according to:
- TDK (Turkish Language Association) rules
- Official correspondence standards
- Spelling and grammar errors
- Punctuation marks
- Preserves meaning while making text more accurate and professional

## Why Should You Install It?

✅ **Professional Content:** Write error-free official documents in WordPress, Drupal, and other CMS platforms
✅ **Save Time:** Correct your text with one click instead of manual proofreading
✅ **TDK Standards:** Full compliance with Turkish Language Association and official correspondence regulations
